It looks like this is your first time visiting Harvester; 
if you pre-set your own bootstrap password, enter it here. 
Otherwise a random one has been generated for you. To find it:
For a "docker run" installation:
Find your container ID with docker ps, then run:
```bash
docker logs container-id 2>&1 | grep "Bootstrap Password:"
```

For a Helm installation, run:
```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace cattle-system bootstrap-secret -o go-template='{{.data.bootstrapPassword|base64decode}}{{"\n"}}'
```
